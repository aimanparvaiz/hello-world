Things I would like to improve:

1. Would like to setup something like: https://github.com/coveo/tgf which allows the whole terragrunt
and TF setup to be available in a container. Especially with TF being sensitive to version each team member can just use this to get started.

2. Bootstrap EKS with Helm TF provider - install dashboard, centralised logging like scalyr, Datadog, external DNS, Traefik etc.

3. Code build and deployment should be done through a proper CI-CD tool like code fresh, circle CI.

4. DB multi az, read replica. Alerting around utilization, disk usage etc.

5. Multiple AWS accounts - Assume role to run a plan.

6. EKS Horizontal pod scaling still have some issues, talk to AWS to get them sorted out.

7. Automate route53 entry creation for hello world app ELB.

8. Spot instances for EKS

9. Explore TF workspaces

10. Container level alerting for example: Crashloop backoff condition.
